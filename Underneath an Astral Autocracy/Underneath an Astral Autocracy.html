There was one issue though, there was so little antimatter in the universe that this engine seemed impossible.

As the fight reaches a fever pitch and Harry is about to gravely hurt John, Obai interupts and says that Kronos isn&#39;t a star, it&#39;s alive in some way and appears to consume energy collected from devoured planets. John passes out. 
The voice, now revealed to be Kronos, defends its actions claiming life moves in cycles.
